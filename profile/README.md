Geplauder is a work-in-progress text-communication service, heavily inspired by [Discord](https://discord.com/) and [Guilded](https://www.guilded.gg/).

It currently consists of two projects:

- [Ferrum](https://github.com/Geplauder/ferrum) - Backend written in Rust with actix-web and sqlx.
- [Oxygen](https://github.com/Geplauder/oxygen) - Frontend written in Typescript with Vite, React, Redux Toolkit and TailwindCSS.
